# Foreman

**AI Reactivation System for HVAC & Field Service Businesses**

> Turn your past customers into booked jobs. Automatically.

Foreman identifies dormant customers, scores them by rebooking probability, reaches out in the operator's voice, classifies responses, proposes real calendar slots, and tracks the revenue it generates — all without the operator managing a CRM.

**Live:** https://web-production-3df3a.up.railway.app
**Repo:** https://github.com/avelayud/foreman

## What It Does

1. Learns operator voice from sent Gmail (Tone Profiler)
2. Scores every past customer 0–100 by rebooking probability (Scoring Engine)
3. Finds dormant customers and drafts personalized outreach in the operator's voice (Reactivation Analyzer)
4. Builds customer context from Gmail correspondence and OutreachLog history (Customer Analyzer — runs daily)
5. Tracks replies by Gmail thread; feeds context-aware follow-up drafts (Reply Detector + Follow-up Sequencer)
6. Classifies inbound responses into 7 categories: booking intent → propose slots, not interested → answer their question conversationally, unsubscribe → suppress
7. Reads Google Calendar to propose real available slots; detects confirmation replies and creates bookings automatically
8. Tracks booked jobs and revenue attributed to Foreman outreach
9. Analytics page: customer base composition, outreach funnel, revenue ROI
10. Product analytics: internal event tracking, draft quality metrics, operator behavior

**Target customer:** HVAC, plumbing, and electrical contractors. Owner-operated teams of 3–15. Not highly technical. HVAC is the primary beachhead.

## Plans System

Feature work is tracked in `plans/` — one folder per job, each containing a `plan.md` and `tasks/` with individual task files. Plans are authored in Claude app and executed in Claude Code. Completed job folders are removed; context lives in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.

## Dashboard Priority Groups

| Group | Who | Primary Action |
|---|---|---|
| 📅 Upcoming Jobs | `booked` | Confirm details, prepare for service |
| 🔥 Active — Requires Attention | `replied`, `outreach_sent`, in-sequence | Book Call or Draft Follow-up |
| 🎯 Ripe for Reactivation | `never_contacted`, ranked by score | Draft Outreach |
| ⏸ On Hold / Declined | `sequence_complete`, `unsubscribed` | Monitor |

---

## Customer Scoring Model

| Signal | Max Points | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| Recency | 40 | Days since last job; >365 days = full 40, scales linearly below |
| Lifetime value | 20 | >$2000 = 20, >$500 = 10, else 5 |
| Job frequency | 15 | Count of jobs × 3, capped at 15 |
| Job type | 15 | Any maintenance job = 15, repair-only = 8, single job = 4 |
| Prior engagement | 10 | Prior positive response = 10, any reply = 5, none = 0 |

Priority tiers: **high** ≥70 · **medium** 40–69 · **low** <40.

---

## Response Classification

| Classification | Example | Next Action |
|---|---|---|
| `booking_intent` | "Yes, when can you come?" | Propose 3 real calendar slots |
| `booking_confirmed` | "Tuesday at 10am works for me" | Create Booking record + GCal event |
| `callback_request` | "Call me to discuss" | Flag for operator, surface phone number |
| `price_inquiry` | "How much would that cost?" | Draft pricing response |
| `not_interested` | "Not right now, but what does a tune-up include?" | Draft conversational reply |
| `unsubscribe_request` | "Please remove me from your list" | Mark unsubscribed, suppress all future outreach |
| `unclear` | Ambiguous reply | Surface to operator with full context |

## Railway

- `Procfile`: `web: python -m api.run`
- DB URL normalization handles `postgres://` → `postgresql://` automatically
- Startup retries handle transient DB boot races
- To connect to Postgres from local: `railway login` → `railway link` → `railway connect Postgres`

---

## Security

Rotate immediately if any of these are exposed:
- Anthropic API key
- Google OAuth client secret
- Railway Postgres credentials
- Twilio Auth Token (Phase 9)
